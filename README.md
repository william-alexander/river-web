river-web
=========

A browser client for River servers

Usage
-----

The client is hosted at wwalexander.github.io/river-web. You can access it there
or host the client yourself if you wish. Note that the protocol (`http/https`)
of the client must match that of the River server (e.g. if the River server you
are connecting to uses `http`, the client must also use `http`).

The server to connect to is specified in the URL. For instance, if the River
server was running on `www.mydomain.com` via `https` and was accessible through
port 21313, it could be accessed at
https://wwalexander.github.io/river-web/?www.mydomain.com:21313.
