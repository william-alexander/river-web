river-web
=========

A browser client for River servers

Usage
-----

The client is hosted at wwalexander.github.io/river-web. You can access it there
or host the client yourself if you wish. If the server you are connected to uses
unencrypted HTTP, the browser client must be access via unencrypted HTTP as
well.

The server and port to connect to can be prepopulated via URL parameters. For
instance,
`https://wwalexander.github.io/river-web/?server=mydomain.com&port=47871` would
pre-populate the Server field with `https://mydomain.com` and the Port field
with `47871`.
