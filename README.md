river-web
=========

A browser client for River servers

Usage
-----

The client is hosted at wwalexander.github.io/river-web. You can access it there
or host the client yourself if you wish. If the server you are connected to uses
unencrypted HTTP, the browser client must be access via unencrypted HTTP as
well.

The server, port, and protocol to connect with can be prepopulated via URL
parameters, i.e.
`https://wwalexander.github.io/river-web/?server=mydomain.com&port=47871&protocol=http`.
